 Currently I am a student at Northwestern University working on my M.S. in Artificial Intelligence ([MSAI](https://ai.northwestern.edu)) and a summer intern at NASA. I am interested in building applications utilizing machine learning and A.I. that are reproduceable, testable, and extendable. Previously, I worked as a software developer primary building mobile applications. The purpose of this site is to share my some of my projects, thoughts, and ideas. I live with my girlfriend and 2 cats in Chicago.
